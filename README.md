## About

A simple, performant voxel sculpting tool made with Rust.

## Progress

I'm planning on just implementing a simple sparse voxel octree data structure and iterating over it to generate a mesh using something like marching cubes. I'm still just prototyping ideas and there won't be anything visible until I've implemented both of those things.
