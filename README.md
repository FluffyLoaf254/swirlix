# Swirlix

## About

A simple, performant voxel sculpting tool made with Rust.

## Progress

I'm planning on just implementing a simple sparse voxel octree data structure and iterating over it to generate a mesh using something like marching cubes. You can now sculpt with spheres (but yet only view them in 2D).
