# Swirlix

## About

A simple, performant voxel sculpting tool made with Rust.

## Status

I've just started this project, and a lot of features are missing or unoptimized.

## Implementation

- Sparse Voxel Octree data structure
- Ray Marching for depth and color
- Normal map generation from depth
- Physically-Based Rendering shader
